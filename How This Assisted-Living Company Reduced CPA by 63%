Introduction

In the competitive environment of the senior housing industry, effective marketing strategies and systems play a critical role in acquiring new customers and driving business growth.
Customer acquisition in the seniors housing industry can be challenging when dealing with long sales cycles and common cash flow issues.
Like many others in the industry, our client faced significant challenges with high cost-per-acquisition (CPA) due to its unreliable (and frankly, outdated) marketing strategies and processes.
Rising marketing costs and fluctuating leads were impacting their profitability and prompting them to look for innovative solutions to address this glaring issue.
Managing and recruiting in-house marketing teams can prove to be an ineffective time and money drain when dealing with poor leadership and mediocre expertise.
It’s a fact that hiring an in-house team will always be more expensive, risky and time-consuming than bringing in external help, such as a specialist agency or, at the very least, expert consultancy. It becomes very difficult to lead people somewhere if you don’t know how best to get there yourself.
Background and context

In any industry, CPA (cost per acquisition) is a key metric to measure and optimize. All it takes is a few bad plays, or simply stagnation in innovation, for it to spike and your overall profitability to plummet.
The assisted-living industry is driven by a growing demand for quality care and services for the elderly population. With an increasing number of companies vying for the attention of potential clients and their families, the importance of effective marketing strategies cannot be overstated.
The culprit was that they had simply become too relaxed and stopped innovating and optimizing, which is what happens when you take things into your own hands for long enough instead of letting other experts do it for you.
The Solution

We got in touch with our client’s Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) and held two Google Meets calls to explore their specific challenges, issues and strategies.
In a strategic alignment of expertise and needs, we partnered with our client through a simple 12-month contract. This agreement cemented our mutual commitment to achieving their marketing objectives and guaranteed results, ensuring they only pay for success.
To address the high CPA issue, Leadcare developed a data-driven solution based on industry expertise. Leadcare recognised the need to A/B test new campaigns on proven marketing channels, eliminate current underperforming channels and relentlessly optimize like there’s no tomorrow.
And while some people think this is just a front-end marketing issue, the truth goes much deeper, often only because of or in conjunction with back-end issues such as the underlying sales structure and lead funnel.
This is where the complete difference of Leadcare comes in, we address every part of your lead funnel, sales processes, sales management and how they work in harmony with each other.
Implementation

1 — Sales Processes
After a seamless onboarding process, we wasted no time in implementing remarkable improvement for our client. We replaced outdated sales techniques with our proven in-house methods, boosting conversion rates by prioritizing customer needs and psychology.
2 — Sales Team
We evaluated the performance of every sales representative, terminated contracts with the bottom 30% of the team, recruited two new representatives, and revised the compensation plan accordingly.
As a result, conversion rates and sales metrics improved significantly and immediately.
3 — Marketing Campaign (Lead Generation)

We made the following key decisions that produced remarkable results:
Firstly, we shifted ad spending from ineffective platforms (Traditional media & Facebook Ads) to Google Ads & local SEO.
Using our expertise, we raised Google Ads spending from $0 to $14.5k in a month. Achieving an impressive 4.3x ROAS by outmaneuvering our competitors’ listings.with secret optimization techniques.
We crafted a 12-month local SEO and backlink plan, diligently executed it with top-notch blog content, and by month 4, our strategy secured their #1 Google city ranking. This competitive dominance led to 95% of organic traffic flowing to their business.
But we didn’t stop there, we used the data from our buyer personas to create a targeted retargeting campaign. This data-driven approach allowed us to tailor our messaging to the needs and preferences of our prospects.
The retargeting campaign surpassed expectations with a 7.9x ROAS over 12 months, solidifying our industry leadership and underlined the importance of using data insights to create highly effective marketing campaigns.
Leadcare’s comprehensive and innovative marketing strategies demonstrated the power of adaptability, data-driven decision-making and a relentless commitment to achieving exceptional results.
By doing this, we not only grew our client’s customer base and revenue streams, but also strengthened their position as a significant contender in the market and as a leading player in the region.
As we aim for excellence in our marketing strategies, these achievements lay the groundwork for this assisted-living business’ future efforts and the sustained long-term expansion of our client’s business and reputation.
4 — Lead Nurture

Our client was severely lacking in the lead nurture department, so we had to build it from the ground up.
We developed our proven strategy but tailored it to their data & infrastructure by implementing:
All aimed at the top of the funnel, Leadcare provided all the tested messaging, templates, visuals etc.
Tip: To effectively re-engage leads, offer genuine value in your outbound communication. Be helpful without being pushy to earn appreciation instead of annoying leads.
5 — Lead Conversion

We then provided a full training session for the sales team, focusing on their weaknesses (in this case mainly closing the sale). This boosted collective sales performance by 13%, effectively generating an additional $28,500 per month for our client for just a few hours of training.
6 — Referral Campaign

Then we started a referral campaign using the Leadcare guide. This included paying our current clients and their families half the value of each new client they referred to us. (Each successful referral was worth around $1800)
The success of the campaign can be attributed to two key factors:
Generous rewards: We offered substantial rewards for successful referrals, motivating our clients and their families to actively participate in the programme and recommend our services to their friends.
Expanded Referral Scope: In a strategic move, we expanded the referral programme to include any person within the customer’s family who could refer potential leads to us. This approach significantly widened our potential customer base and increased the overall reach of the campaign.
The results exceeded all expectations as we witnessed a staggering influx of new customers with a collective Lifetime Value (LTV) of approximately $9,000,000 (rounded figure) in just 12 months. Remarkably, this was achieved without any additional lead acquisition spend during this period other than the money reinvested.
This phenomenal result has reaffirmed the importance of harnessing the power of word of mouth and the value of nurturing strong relationships with our existing customer base.
We not only created a robust stream of new customers, but also strengthened the loyalty of our existing customer base by incentivising and empowering them to become brand advocates.
This success story has become a beacon for our industry, inspiring us to continually innovate and explore new ways to grow and expand.
